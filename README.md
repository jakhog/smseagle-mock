# Description
This project contains a node.js server that mocks the API of the SMSeagle.
It's intended use is for (somewhat limited) testing of services that rely on an SMSeagle, but without using an actual device, and sending actual messages.

The API and behaviour is implemented to my best ability based on the [public documentation](https://www.smseagle.eu/api/) of the API, and my limited knowledge of the device.

If anyone is interested in using it (wow) and finds any inconsistencies with the actual API, just post an issue so I can fix it.
